Title: Topologically aware inference as an alternative to kernel density estimation

Description: This package is modeled after the kernel density estimator of the package hypervolume. Here, the main function hypervolume_t takes in a dataframe in as many dimensions as columns, and as many samples as rows. Given two distance paramaters, it creates a sample (usually) larger than the input sample, filling in any small voids, but preserving larger voids, considered indicative of the topology of the underlying space.
